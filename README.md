Project made with React, movies application
The idea of the project is to create an application in which you can search any movie by connecting it with TheMovieDB API, be able to see the information of the movies, such as the poster, the rating, also have the option to apply sorting filters. To be able to add, delete and access to favorites list as long as the user is authenticated through a login, and as an extra point I added the function to watch the trailer of the movie in the same app.

Things to do: Connect it to an own server and database to be able to save all the data, add movies, and create roles as administrator and responsive design.

To initialize the project:

- npm install
- npm start
